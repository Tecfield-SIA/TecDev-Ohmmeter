## Introduction

This project introduces an innovative automatic ohmmeter that eliminates the need for high-side switching and diodes, providing a more accurate and efficient resistance measurement. Unlike traditional voltage divider-based ohmmeters that suffer from voltage drops due to series diodes, this design employs low-side switching using logic-gate MOSFETs, resulting in minimal voltage loss and improved precision.

## How It Works

Traditional ohmmeters use a high-side switch controlled by a microcontroller, where the reference resistors are connected in series with an unknown resistor. However, to prevent backflow of current into the microcontroller, diodes are placed in series, causing a significant voltage drop, especially in low-voltage systems. My approach replaces this with:

- A constant and stable 3.3V current source to power the unknown resistor.
- Reference resistors placed after the unknown resistor, switching to ground through logic-gate MOSFETs controlled by the microcontroller.
- Automatic resistance detection, as the system continuously reads the analog pin. Once a resistor is placed in the circuit, the microcontroller immediately detects and starts the measurement cycle.

## Key Advantages

- No diode voltage drop, leading to significantly improved accuracy.
- Automatic detection of the unknown resistor, eliminating the need for manual triggering.
- High-speed operation due to MOSFET switching.
- Protects the microcontroller, as current never flows directly into it.
- Scalable accuracy, by increasing the number of reference resistors.
- Can be used as a noise detector, as environmental noise may trigger readings when no resistor is present.
- Can measure skin resistance by simply touching the test pads.
